As there are more math than code this week, it is a very good opportunity to practice using LaTeX skills; love it or hate it, one of the main reasons for LaTeX is to typeset math beautifully. Whilst you can submit a scan of a handwritten proof, do consider taking the time to convert it to LaTeX, as it will greatly ease the job of your TA.

- Template for LaTeX Proof ([pdf](template.pdf), [tex](template.tex)) - this will get you started
- [LaTeX Math for Undergrads](undergradmath.pdf) - this will cover almost any symbol you need
